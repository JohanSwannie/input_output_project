Stewart Smith is an old man, propped up on a zimmer frame in the morning darkness.
He is delicate on his feet, re-learning how to walk after surgery on one hip and both legs,
watching in silence as they raid his workshop, the product of his life's work.
It was 5am, and they numbered around 30. They broke the chains on the fence surrounding the building.
They quietly moved past a giant concrete tank sucking water through a bore and feeding it through the building.
